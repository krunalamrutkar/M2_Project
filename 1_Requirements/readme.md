# What is Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment

Continuous integration is the process of automatically detecting, pulling, building, and doing unit testing as source code is updated. CI is the primary step that starts the pipeline. The goal is to check the new changes from team members quickly are “good” and suitable for further use in the codebase.

Continuous deployment goes a little further than continuous delivery. Every enhancement that clears all stages of your production pipeline is released to your customers. Without any human intervention, only a failed test will prevent new growth from being deployed to production. Continuous deployment is an excellent way to speed up the feedback loop with your clients and take the pressure off the team.


# What CI/CD has to do with code quality?

CI and CD make the keystone of the modern DevOps environment. Nowadays, the CI/CD concept is everywhere, as it makes deployment faster and effective. Through CI/CD, one can be sure that your system is working, regardless of the changes you make. This gives you the certainty to analyze, actualize new features, and ship updates quickly.
